This program is accompanied by a circuit driven by an Arduino UNO microcontroller. The overall system when implemented on a glove allows users that are paralyzed, mute and functionally disabled to increase communication to
caretakers through simple finger movements. When a particular finger is bent to some angle, the flex sensor on the finger sends a singal to display an important message corresponding to that finger on to an LCD display.
A buzzer is also buzzed upon bending of the fingers so that a caretaker is notified to pay attention to the message on the LCD screen (i.e "I need to use the bathroom"). 

NOTE: Upon bending of the last finger on the hand, an emergency message is displayed on the screen in case of an emergancy and an RGB LED starts flashing with the buzzer buzzing.
